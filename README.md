## Project Description

This project is a classic memory game where players flip pairs of cards and try to match them. When two cards with the same image are flipped, they stay face up; otherwise they flip back down. The goal is to match all the cards in as few moves as possible.

---

## Features

- Flip cards to reveal images
- Match pairs of cards
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Smooth animations for card flipping
- Restart game functionality

---

## Tech Stack

- **React** â€” for building the user interface
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** â€” core language
- **CSS / SCSS** â€” styling and animations

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd memory-game
npm install
```

### Running the App

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the game.

## How to Play

1. Click a card to flip it and reveal the image.
2. Click a second card to flip it.

   - If the two flipped cards match, they remain open.
   - If they donâ€™t match, they flip back down after a short delay.

3. Continue until all pairs are matched.
4. Your score is based on the number of moves you take â€” try to beat your best!
